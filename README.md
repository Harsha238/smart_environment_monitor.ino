# Smart Environmental Monitoring System (ESP32 + DHT11)

This project measures real-time temperature and humidity using an ESP32 microcontroller
and a DHT11 sensor.

## Features
- Reads temperature and humidity every 2 seconds
- Displays data on Serial Monitor
- Designed using Embedded C in Arduino IDE
- Can be extended to Wi-Fi cloud monitoring

## Hardware Used
- ESP32
- DHT11 sensor
- Jumper wires

## Software Used
- Arduino IDE

## How it works
The ESP32 reads data from the DHT11 sensor and prints temperature and humidity values
to the serial monitor in real time.
